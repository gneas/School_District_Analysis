# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of school district data using Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Python.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this challenge project was to provide an analysis of school district data, but also to adjust the analysis given the discovery of academic dishonesty discovered within the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. 

## Results
- District Summary Changes: From a district standpoint there was a minor reduction in the average math score and passing percentages illustrated in the comparison below.

- Thomas High School Summary Changes: The district changes above correspond with the slight drops at Thomas High School due to the removal of results with the 9th graders there.

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following: Aside from the above minor changes mentioned, the situation around the 9th grade acedemic dishonesty has not affected scores from a spending, size, or type perspective. From a grade level standpoint, obviously because we've removed out the results for the 9th graders at Thomas High School, we do not currently know how this class is performing. This is something which will need to be addressed.

## Summary
As reflected above, it is clear that there are several changes that have occurred. The 9th graders at Thomas High School will need to be reassessed to properly understanding their performance. It follows that this situation has affected Thomas High Schools' analysis from a school standpoint as well as at a district level. It is theoretically possible and will have to be considered that once they are reassessed that could affect the school's performance relative to the other schools in the district.
